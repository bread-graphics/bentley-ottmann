# bentley-ottmann

The Bentley-Ottmann algorithm is a fast, efficient algorithm for finding the intersections of a set of lines. It is believed to operate in `O((n + k) log n)`, where `n` is the number of line segments, and `k` is the number of intersections.

This crate provides a `no_std`, fully safe, pure-Rust implementation of the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm.
